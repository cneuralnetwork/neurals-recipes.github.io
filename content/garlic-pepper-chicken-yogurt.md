# Garlic Pepper Chicken with Lemon Yogurt Sauce

A low-carb, high-protein chicken recipe that actually tastes good and doesn't feel like diet food.

## Why this works

* **High protein:** chicken breast
* **Very low carbs:** no flour, no sugar
* **High flavor:** garlic, pepper, lemon, yogurt acidity

## Ingredients (1–2 servings)

### Chicken

* **200–250 g** chicken breast
* **1 tsp** olive oil
* **3–4** garlic cloves, finely chopped
* **1 tsp** crushed black pepper
* **1/2 tsp** paprika or chili flakes
* **Salt** to taste
* **Juice of 1/2** lemon

### Lemon Yogurt Sauce

* **3 tbsp** thick curd / Greek yogurt
* **1 tbsp** lemon juice
* **1 small** garlic clove, grated
* **Salt**
* **Black pepper**

### Optional sides (still low-carb)

* Sautéed zucchini / beans / broccoli
* Fresh cucumber salad

## Method

### Prep the chicken

1. Slice chicken into thin pieces
2. Marinate with salt, pepper, paprika, lemon juice, and half the garlic
3. Rest for 10 minutes

### Cook

1. Heat olive oil in a pan on medium-high
2. Add remaining garlic, sauté briefly until fragrant
